Zarr
====

Zarr is a Python package providing an implementation of chunked,
compressed, N-dimensional arrays.

Highlights
----------

* Create N-dimensional arrays with any NumPy dtype.
* Chunk arrays along any dimension.
* Compress chunks using the fast Blosc_ meta-compressor or alternatively using zlib, BZ2 or LZMA.
* Store arrays in memory, on disk, inside a Zip file, on S3, ...
* Read an array concurrently from multiple threads or processes.
* Write to an array concurrently from multiple threads or processes.
* Organize arrays into hierarchies via groups.

Status
------

Zarr is still in an early phase of development. Feedback and bug
reports are very welcome, please get in touch via the `GitHub issue
tracker <https://github.com/alimanfoo/zarr/issues>`_.

Installation
------------

Zarr depends on NumPy. It is generally best to `install NumPy
<http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html>`_ first using
whatever method is most appropriate for you operating system and
Python distribution.

Install Zarr from PyPI::

    $ pip install zarr

Alternatively, install Zarr via conda::

    $ conda install -c conda-forge zarr
  
Zarr includes a C extension providing integration with the Blosc_
library. Installing on any operating system via conda or installing on
Windows via pip will install a pre-compiled binary
distribution. However, if you have a newer CPU that supports the AVX2
instruction set (e.g., Intel Haswell, Broadwell or Skylake) then
compiling from source is preferable as the Blosc library includes some
optimisations for AVX2::
  
    $ pip install --no-binary=:all: zarr
 
To work with Zarr source code in development, install from GitHub::

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/alimanfoo/zarr.git
    $ cd zarr
    $ python setup.py install

To verify that Zarr has been fully installed (including the Blosc
extension) run the test suite::

    $ pip install nose zict heapdict
    $ python -m nose -v zarr

Acknowledgments
---------------

Zarr bundles the `c-blosc <https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc>`_
library and uses it as the default compressor.

Zarr is inspired by `HDF5 <https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_, `h5py
<http://www.h5py.org/>`_ and `bcolz <http://bcolz.blosc.org/>`_.

Development of this package is supported by the
`MRC Centre for Genomics and Global Health <http://www.cggh.org>`_.
